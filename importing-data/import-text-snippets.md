# Import Text Snippets

You can import text snippets to quickly set up an NLP dataset.

Start by navigating to `Samples > Import > Import Text Snippets`

{% hint style="info" %}
Import Text Snippets will only appear if you have a Text Interface as your dataset's interface e.g. `Text Classification`
{% endhint %}
