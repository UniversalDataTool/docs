We're still waiting on a contributor to write this page. If you'd like to help out, click the Edit on Github button above!

## Setup the Dataset

Navigate to [udt.dev](https://udt.dev) and click "New File"

![Click &quot;New File&quot; on udt.dev](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

Then select the Image Segmentation button from the `Setup > Data Type` page.

You can configure the Image Segmentation to create the right interface for your dataset. Use the `Setup > Preview` button to see your interface against either an example image or a sample from your dataset.

#### Configuring Regions and Labels

The Image Segmentation interface allows different types of regions, the options for regions are:

* bounding-box
* polygon

Each region can any number of labels, which can be configured under "Available Labels"

## Import Data

You can use any of the following methods to import image data. If you're just getting started, you can quickly create a dataset using the COCO Images method!

* [Import COCO Dialog](../importing-data/coco-images.md)
* [Import from Google Drive](../importing-data/import-from-google-drive.md)
* [Import from AWS S3 Bucket](../importing-data/import-from-aws-s3-bucket.md)
* [Import from List of URLs](../importing-data/import-file-urls.md)
* [Import from CSV or JSON](../importing-data/import-from-csv-or-json.md)
